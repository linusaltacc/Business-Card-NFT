# Business Card NFT

This project allows users to mint, transfer, and burn business card NFTs, which represents digital counterparts of physical business cards. The BusinessCardNFT contract maintains a ledger of users' business card information, such as name, title, company, email, and phone number. It also tracks the total supply of NFTs. Users can transfer business card NFTs between accounts and burn them if needed.
